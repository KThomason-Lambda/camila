            <div class="info">
                <p>My wife is the greatest wife a man (or woman) could ask for. She is so caring
                    and loving. She has shown me what what true love is. She's a beacon of light 
                    in the darkness that has been my life. Her smile brightens up my day and her
                    laughter can lift anyone's spirits.

        <h2>My wife is amazing cook.</h2>
            <p>My wife is a vegan, so she never uses products that come from animals in her cooking.
               You would be amazed at the things she can make without animal products. She has made 
               pulled pork sandwiches where the pork was substituted with a fruit called jackfruit. 
               It tasted just like pulled pork and had the same consitency. If you want to learn more
